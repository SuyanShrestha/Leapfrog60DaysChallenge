Hello, this is Suyan Shrestha. I'm participating in the Leapfrog 60-days challenge, and today marks my fourth day.

Today, I delved deeper into MongoDB, exploring its comparison and logical operators, and element query operators like type and exists. Each day brings new knowledge and I'm eager for what's next!

## Summary:
- **Comparison Operators**: Learnt about lte, gte, lt, gt, eq, ne, in, nin.
- **Logical Operators**: Explored and, or, nor, not.
- **Element Query Operators**: Understood the use of type and exists.

For those interested, you can find the practice code on my GitHub: [SuyanShrestha/Leapfrog60DaysChallenge](https://github.com/SuyanShrestha/Leapfrog60DaysChallenge)

Thank you.
