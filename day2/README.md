Hello, this is Suyan Shrestha. I'm participating in the Leapfrog 60-days challenge, and today marks my second day.

Today, I continued my journey with MongoDB and focused on expanding my knowledge on schema validation and updating it using the runCommand feature. Additionally, I explored the usage of the map function within MongoDB for more efficient data manipulation.

Summary:
In MongoDB, schema validation ensures data integrity by enforcing rules on document structure and content. Using the runCommand feature, I was able to update schema validation rules dynamically, adapting to evolving data needs. The map function, on the other hand, allowed me to transform data efficiently, facilitating complex operations across documents.

For those interested, you can find the practice code on my GitHub:

Thank you.
