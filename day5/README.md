Hello, this is Suyan Shrestha. I'm participating in the Leapfrog 60-days challenge, and today marks my fifth day.

Today, I switched gears from non-relational to relational databases, diving into MySQL. It was an insightful session where I learned about various SQL commands and operations that are fundamental to working with relational databases.

## Summary:

- **GROUP BY:** Used for aggregating data based on specific columns.
- **HAVING:** Applied to filter results after a `GROUP BY`.
- **ORDER BY:** Used to sort the result set based on specified columns.
- **Joins:** Explored different types of joins:
  - **Inner Join:** Combines records with matching values in both tables.
  - **Left Join:** Includes all records from the left table and matched records from the right table.
  - **Right Join:** Includes all records from the right table and matched records from the left table.
  - **Full Outer Join:** Combines all records when there is a match in either table.
  - **Self Join:** Joins a table with itself.
- **UPDATE:** Used to modify existing records in a table.
- **DELETE:** Used to remove records from a table.
- **ALTER:** Used to modify the structure of an existing table.

Thank you.
