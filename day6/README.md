Hello, this is Suyan Shrestha. I'm participating in the Leapfrog 60-days challenge, and today marks my sixth day.

Today, I focused on learning various Linux commands. It was an engaging session where I covered commands in four different sections and documented them with usable screenshots and examples.

## Summary:

### Directories
- **cd**: Change directory.
- **ls**: List directory contents.
  - `-l`: Use a long listing format.
  - `-a`: Include directory entries whose names begin with a dot (`.`).
- **mkdir**: Make directories.
- **rmdir**: Remove empty directories.

### Files
- **touch**: Create an empty file or update the timestamp of an existing file.
- **cp**: Copy files or directories.
  - `-r`: Copy directories recursively.
- **mv**: Move or rename files or directories.
- **rm**: Remove files or directories.
  - `-r`: Remove directories and their contents recursively.

### Man
- **man**: Display the user manual of any command.
  - `man [command]`: Get detailed information about a command.

### File Contents
- **cat**: Concatenate and display file content.
- **more**: View file content one screen at a time.
- **less**: View file content with backward movement.
- **head**: Output the first part of files.
- **tail**: Output the last part of files.
  - `-f`: Follow the output as the file grows.
