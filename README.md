# Leapfrog60DaysChallenge
Here's all my code and learning that I did throughout my 60 days of Learning with Leaprfrog journey, kicking off from June 1, 2024. For the starters, I have planned on learning MongoDB, MySQL, Redux Toolkit and Typescript, followed by expanding my knowledge over React and React Native (and even more! which will come by a surprise)
