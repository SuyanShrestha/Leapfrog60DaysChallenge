#Day25ofClg_askmitra #Clg_askmitra30days

Hello, this is Suyan Shrestha. As you all know I'm participating in the ITSNP X Askmitra 30-days challenge and Today is my twenty-fifth day. I encourage everyone to begin their 30 days by learning anything they choose; it will be fun. I’m excited already. If you want to start learning more about this program here: https://clg.askmitra.com

Today, I started learning about usage of Redux in React Native. HEre's what I learnt today:
- WHat is Redux
- Basic Architecture of Redux
THen, I made a simple UI to understand usage of redux, where there are mobile items, with their basic info and add to cart button. Then, i also figured out what action means here.

Practice Code is present at my github :
