#SuyanScripts

Hello, this is Suyan Shrestha. As you all know I'm participating in the Leapfrog 60-days challenge and Today is my first day.
Today, I just did some comfort learning and learnt a bit more about MongoDB. Today I learnt about some operators for aggregation pipelines in MongoDB like:
- $match
- $sort
- $gt, $lt, $gte, $eq, $lte
- $group

Summary:
In MongoDB, operators play crucial roles in querying and aggregating data efficiently. The $match operator filters documents based on specified criteria, facilitating data retrieval. Meanwhile, the $sort operator arranges documents in ascending or descending order, enhancing result organization. Comparison operators like $gt, $lt, $gte, $eq, and $lte enable precise querying by evaluating conditions such as greater than, less than, equal to, and more. Lastly, the $group operator groups documents by specified keys, enabling powerful aggregation operations like summing, counting, and averaging, thereby providing comprehensive insights into the data.

Practice Code is present at my github :
