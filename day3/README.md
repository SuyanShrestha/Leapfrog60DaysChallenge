Hello, this is Suyan Shrestha. I'm participating in the Leapfrog 60-days challenge, and today marks my third day.

Today, I continued my journey with MongoDB, delving into some foundational concepts to deepen my understanding. I explored writeConcern for controlling write acknowledgments, journaling for ensuring data integrity, mongoimport for efficient data import, and the concept of atomicity in operations to understand how MongoDB handles transactions.

## Summary:
- **writeConcern:** Ensures the level of acknowledgment MongoDB provides when writing data, allowing control over data durability.
- **Journaling:** A mechanism that helps maintain data integrity by recording changes before they are applied.
- **mongoimport:** A tool that facilitates the import of data into MongoDB, streamlining the process of adding large datasets.
- **Atomicity:** Understanding atomic operations in MongoDB to learn how transactions are handled, ensuring data consistency.

For those interested, you can find the practice code on my GitHub:

Thank you.
